                This is ISCED level 01.[56] Preschools provide education from ages approximately three to seven,
                depending on the country when children enter primary education. The children now readily interact with
                their peers and the educator.[56] These are also known as nursery schools and as kindergarten, except in
                the US, where the term kindergarten refers to the earliest levels of primary education.[58] Kindergarten
                "provides a child-centred, preschool curriculum for three- to seven-year-old children that aim[s] at
                unfolding the child's physical, intellectual, and moral nature with balanced emphasis on each of
                them."[59] This is ISCED level 02.</p>

            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Education is a purposeful activity directed at achieving certain aims,
                such as transmitting knowledge or fostering skills and character traits. These aims may include the
                development of understanding, rationality, kindness, and honesty. Various researchers emphasize the role
                of critical thinking in order to distinguish education from indoctrination. Some theorists require that
                education results in an improvement of the student while others prefer a value-neutral definition of the
                term. </p>

                that the motivation responsible for formal education is predominantly extrinsic, whereas it tends to be
                mainly intrinsic for non-formal and informal education.[33] The distinction between the three types is
                normally clear for the paradigmatic cases but there are various intermediate forms of education that do
                not easily fall into one category.[32][33]

                Formal education plays a central role in modern civilization. But in primitive cultures, most of the
                education happens not on the formal but on the informal level.[25][37][38] This usually means that there
                is no distinction between activities focused on education and other activities. Instead, the whole
                environment may be seen as a form of school and many or all adults may act as teachers. </p>
